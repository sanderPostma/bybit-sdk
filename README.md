# Bybit SDK
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

#### An OpenAPI 3 SDK generator based on the old Bybit version and the updated documentation.
This is only done for the Java OKHTTP-GSON client and contains only the API functions I need.

This project is using modified code generatetor templates, see fork https://github.com/sanderPostma/swagger-codegen-generators
